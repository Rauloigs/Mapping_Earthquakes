# Mapping_Earthquakes

The pupose of the Mapping Earthquake Challenge directory, was to provide more feature to our map. This features were the following: 
- Tectonic Plates displayed on the map.
- Earthquake visible data (circleMarker) of earthquakes above 4.5 of magnitude. 
- To provide the user with another map mode. In myu case I provided the night mode map.
